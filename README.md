#### Note: [thecelineteh](https://github.com/thecelineteh) contributed as [B1601563](https://github.com/B1601563).

A collaborative project with [Daenise](https://github.com/Daenise) for the course BIT210 Web Programming at HELP University, Malaysia. Our goal was to develop a responsive web application based on the case study of HELPFit, which is an initiative that aims to connect fitness trainers and members. This version only consists of the front-end web design (part 1) for HELPFit, and uses the following coding platform/languages: 
* HTML5
* CSS
* Bootstrap 
* JavaScript

The latest full-stack [HELPFit](https://github.com/thecelineteh/HELPFit) web version (includes both front- and back-end) is available [here](https://github.com/thecelineteh/HELPFit), which is similar to the course BIT216 Software Engineering Principles for the [Jinjang Empowerment E-business (JEE)](https://github.com/thecelineteh/Jinjang-Empowerment-Ebusiness) case study project which I collaborated with [AdrianFoo97](https://github.com/AdrianFoo97).
